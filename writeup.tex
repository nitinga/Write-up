\begin{abstract}
Matrix completion, is the task of filling in the unknown entries of a sparse matrix. In the present paper, the baseline algorithms for matrix completion, such as eigentaste, nearest K-neighbor, and column mean are compared against the more sophisticated matrix completion algorithms, such as Spectral Matrix Completion (SMC) and Singular Value Thresholding (SVT). The comparison metric used in the present paper includes accuracy, convergence time, and the nature of the input matrix. All of the presented methods have their advantages and disadvantages based on the problem. In the present paper, the Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) are presented for synthetic data and the real-world data (Jester jokes dataset). While Eigentaste needs at least few fully filled columns to complete the sparse matrix, SMC and SVT does not have that limitation. Between SMC and SVT, SMC provides better accuracy but is much slower than the SVT.

\section{Introduction}

How can we predict what movies a person will enjoy? On what web-pages
will they click? Which emails will they read? \emph{Collaborative
  Filtering} problems like these are tricky. Consider predicting a
person's movie preferences using Netflix's database. We can predict
how highly a user will rate the movie \textit{Rambo} using a
regression model trained on the ratings of users that have rated
\textit{Rambo} before. We quickly run into problems when we realize
that most users have not rated \textit{Rambo}, and most users who
have, have not rated the same ones as the user for whom we are making
the prediction. This means that our model would have to ignore a
majority of the data available, limiting performance. Furthermore a
separate model would need to be trained for each movie in the system,
leading to computational difficulties.

A better framework for these sorts of problem is \emph{matrix
  completion}. We can view each user-item pair as an entry in a matrix
that has only a few entries filled in. Our task is then to complete
the matrix, assuming that it has some simple underlying structure. Low
rank is a common structural assumption. Recovering a low rank matrix
from a few entries is a problem with applications not only in
collaborative filtering~\cite{r25}, but also in dimensionality
reduction~\cite{r20, r28} and multi-task learning~\cite{r2, r22}. This
problem turns out to be computationally hard. In fact, rank
minimization is NP-hard, meaning that is at least as hard as all those
that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial
time, like the Hamiltonian Cycle~\cite{plesn} and Traveling Salesman problems~\cite{lawler1985}. In
both theory and practice, all algorithms that perform this task have
time complexity exponential in the size of the matrix.

Candes and Recht showed that most low-rank matrices could be recovered instead by minimizing the nuclear norm, defined as the sum of the
singular values~\cite{r4}. Theoretically, the nuclear
norm is the tightest convex lower bound on the rank function for
singular values no greater than 1. Intuitively, while the rank
function counts the number of nonzero singular values, the nuclear
norm sums their amplitude, much like how the 1-norm is a useful
substitute for counting the number of nonzero entries in a vector.
Conveniently, the nuclear norm can be minimized efficiently subject to
equality constraints via semidefinite programming.

Nuclear norm minimization has long been observed to produce fairly
low-rank solutions~\cite{r11, r12, r26}, but only recently there was
any theoretical basis for the instances where it produced the true minimum rank
solution. One of the first papers to provide such foundation was~\cite{r24},
where Recht, Fazel, and Parrilo developed probabilistic techniques to
study average case behavior. They showed that the nuclear norm heuristic
could solve most instances of the rank minimization problem when the
number of linear constraints were sufficiently large. This inspired interest in theoretical guarantees for rank
minimization, and these results lay the foundation for~\cite{r4}.
Candes and Recht’s bounds were subsequently improved by Candes and Tao~\cite{r7} and Keshavan, Montanari, and Oh~\cite{keshavan2010matrix} to
show that one could, in special cases, reconstruct a low-rank matrix
by observing a set of entries of size at most a polylogarithmic factor
larger than the intrinsic dimension of matrix.

To test the validity of these theoretical guarantees in practice, we
explore two competing algorithms for matrix completion via nuclear
norm-minimization and compare their performance on collaborative
filtering baselines, using both synthetic and real-world data. The
Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm was introduced in ``A
Singular Value Thresholding Algorithm for Matrix Completion''
\cite{cai2010singular}. Spectral Matrix Completion (SMC) was introduced
in ``Matrix Completion from a Few Entries'' \cite{keshavan2010matrix}. 

In Section 2, we explain the methodology and parameters used for the SVT algorithm. Section 3 explains the SMC algorithm with detailed description of the steps involved. Section 4 explains the baseline algorithms used in the present paper, namely, Eigentaste, and K-nearest neighbor. In Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, we present a detailed comparison of the results for synthetic data and real-world data (Jester joke dataset) respectively. Section 5.3 contains the two-dimensional visualization of the Jester joke dataset. Section 6 presents the conclusions, with Section 7 giving a brief overview of the team member's efforts.  


\section{Singular Value Thresholding}

Formally, Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) addresses the optimization
problem
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  & \underset{X}{\text{minimize}} & & \|X\|_{*} \\
  & \text{subject to}             & & \mathcal{P}_\Omega (X) =
  \mathcal{P}_\Omega (M), \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
where $\|\cdot\|_{*}$ is the \emph{nuclear norm}, or the sum of the
singular values and $\mathcal{P}_\Omega (\cdot)$ is the projection
operator, which makes zero all entries $(i, j) \notin \Omega$.

Singular Value Thresholding works in an iterative, alternating fashion
reminiscent of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).
The complete matrix $X$ is constructed iteratively using a low-rank,
low-singular value approximation to an auxiliary sparse matrix $Y$.
$Y$ is then adjusted to ensure the resulting approximation in the
subsequent step has matching entries $X_{ij} = M_{ij}$. Each iteration
consists of the inductive steps
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
X^{k} = \mathrm{shrink}(Y^{k-1}, \tau) \\
Y^{k} = Y^{k-1} + \delta_k \mathcal{P}_\Omega (M-X^{k}),              \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $\mathrm{shrink}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the \emph{singular value
  shrinkage operator}, which reduces each singular value by a given
singular value decomposition $X = U \Sigma V^T$,
$\Sigma = \mathrm{diag}(\{\sigma_i\}_{1 \le i \le r})$, we can write
this as
\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{shrink}(X, \tau) = U\Sigma_\tau V^T, \ \ \Sigma_\tau = \mathrm{diag}(\{(\sigma_i-\tau)_{+}\}).
\end{equation*}


These two operations when repeated, approach a low-nuclear norm
solution by repeatedly shrinking the singular values of X. This
algorithm has shown success in recovering accurate low-rank solutions
when the source of $M$ is also low-rank, even though it does not
optimize this objective directly. The original authors discuss its
theoretical guarantees in detail, but we choose to omit them in this
discussion.

SVT has hyperparameters that must be carefully tuned to guarantee
convergence. The shrinkage value $\tau$ must be set high in order for
the algorithm to converge, but not too high that it exceeds the true
singular values. The step size $\delta_k$ are similarly sensitive. The
step size can be set dynamically as well, though we choose to maintain
a fixed step size throughout. Furthermore, we compute the decomposition
of $Y^K$ in batches, which introduces a new batch size parameter $l$
that effects the speed of convergence. Also important is the
initialization of $Y$, for which the authors provide helpful
strategies. Finally, we use the relative error
$\|\mathcal{P}_{\Omega}(X^k-M)\|_F / \|P_{\Omega} (M)\|$ as a stopping
criterion. We terminate when this drops below a small $\epsilon$.

We find from experimentation that SVT is frustratingly sensitive to
the settings of these parameters. The suggested settings only lead to
convergence for a limited range of matrix sizes and ranks, and
choosing the correct settings often requires unrealistic knowledge of
the underlying matrix structure.

\section{Spectral Matrix Completion}

Spectral Matrix Completion (SMC), presented in Keshavan et al.
\cite{keshavan2010matrix} minimizes the reconstruction error of a
low-rank matrix. Let $M$ be the complete matrix and $M^E$ be the
$m \times n$ matrix with known entries $(i,j) \in E$ filled in and
zero entries otherwise. That is,
\begin{equation}
M^E_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
    M_{i,j} & \text{if} \ \  (i,j) \in E \\
    0      & \text{otherwise}.
   \end{cases}
\end{equation}

As presented in~\cite{keshavan2010matrix}, the SMC algorithm has three
steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trim $M^E$, giving $\widetilde{M}^E$.
\item Project $\widetilde{M}^E$ to $T_r(\widetilde{M}^E)$.
\item Clean, minimizing the reconstruction error $F(X,Y)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Trimming}
In the trimming step, we throw out information in order to make the
underlying true-rank structure more apparent. First, we zero all
columns in $M^E$ with degree larger than $2|E|/n$ and set to zero all
rows with degree larger than $2|E|/m$, where $|E|$ is the number of
non-zero entries in $M$. This step is crucially important when the
number of revealed entries per row/column follows a heavy tail
distribution, as is the case for most of the real data.

\subsection{Projection}
In the projection step, we build a low-rank reconstruction of $M^E$.
We begin by computing its the singular value decomposition (SVD). Let
the singular values be
$\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge ... \sigma_{\min(m,n)} \ge 0$. Therefore,
the decomposition can be written as,
\begin{equation}
  M^E = \sum_{i=1}^{\min(m,n)} \sigma_ix_iy_i^T.
\end{equation}
The projection
\begin{equation}
  T_r(M^E) = \frac{mn}{|E|}\sum\limits_{i=1}^r \sigma_ix_iy_i^T
\end{equation}
is obtained by zeroing all but the $r$ largest singular values. Note
that apart from the rescaling factor $(mn/|E|)$, $T_r(M^E)$ is the
orthogonal projection of $M^E$ onto the set of rank-r matrices. The rank of the matrix, $r$, should either be supplied by the user or it will be estimated using the change in consecutive singular values.

\subsection{Cleaning}
This is the step where actual optimization takes place in SMC algorithm. We
``clean'' the errors produced by the projection step by iteratively
minimizing the reconstruction error. Given $X \in R^{m\times r}$,
$Y \in R^{n\times r}$ with $X^TX = mI$ and $Y^TY = nI$,
\begin{equation}
  F(X,Y) = \min_{S \in R^{r \times r}} F(X,Y,S)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  F(X,Y,S) = \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{(i,j) \in E} (M_{ij} - (XSY^T)_{ij})^2
\end{equation}
We initiliaze $T_r(\widetilde{M}^E) = X_0S_0Y_0^T$ and minimize
$F(X, Y)$ locally with initial condition $X = X_0$, $Y = Y_0$. Note
that $F(X, Y)$ is easy to evaluate since it is defined by minimizing
the quadratic function $S \mapsto F(X, Y, S)$ over the low-dimensional
matrix $S$. Further, it depends on $X$ and $Y$ only through their
column spaces. In geometric terms, $F$ is a function defined over the
cartesian product of two Grassmann manifolds. Optimization over
Grassmann manifolds is a well understood
topic~\cite{edelman1998geometry} and efficient algorithms (in
particular Newton and conjugate gradient) can be applied. In our
implementation, we minimize $F(X, Y)$, using gradient descent with
line search.


\section{Baseline Algorithms}

For comparison, we introduce two simple baseline algorithms for matrix
completion.

\subsection{Eigentaste}

Eigentaste~\cite{r31} is an another collaborative filtering algorithm specifically
designed for the Jester Dataset. It relies on the assumption that a
subset of the columns will be dense, corresponding to a few ``seed''
items which every user is required to review. Eigentaste applies
principal component analysis to this dense subset of columns, reducing
dimensionality and allowing rapid clustering. Recommendation is done
by averaging ratings over clusters.

Mean rating of the jth item in the gauge set is given by
\begin{equation*}
\mu_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i\epsilon U_{j}}}\widetilde{r}_{ij}\\
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_j^2=\frac{1}{n-1}{\sum_{i\epsilon U_{j}}}({\widetilde{r}_{ij}-\mu_{j}})^{2}
\end{equation*}
where $\widetilde{r}_{ij}$ is the user rating of item $j$ by user $i$, $\mu_{j}$ and $\sigma_j$ is the mean and variance of the item $j$, respectively. In A, the normalized rating $r_{ij}$ is set to
$({\widetilde{r}_{ij}-\mu_{j}})/\sigma _{j}$ . The global correlation
matrix is given by
\begin{equation*}
C=\frac{1}{n-1}A^{T}A=E^{T} \Lambda E
\end{equation*}

The data is projected along the first v eigenvectors $x=R{E_{v}}^{T}$, where $R$ is the normalized user rating matrix.

\textit{Recursive Rectangular Clustering: }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the minimal rectangular cell that encloses all the points
  in the eigenplane.
\item Bisect along x and y axis to form 4 rectangular sub-cells.
\item Bisect the cells in step 2 with origin as a vertex to form
  sub-cells at next hierarchical level.
\end{enumerate}

 \textit{Online Computation of Recommendations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect ratings of all items in gauge set.
\item Use PCA to project this vector to eigenplane.
\item Find the representative cluster.
\item Look up appropriate recommendations, present them to the new
  user, and collect ratings.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{K-Nearest Neighbors}
In the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, we predicts ratings based on the
mean ratings of each person's nearest neighbors.
\begin{equation*}
  p_{ij}=\overline{r_{i}}+\kappa\sum_{k=1}^n w(i,p)(\overline{r_{pj}}-\overline{r_{p}})
\end{equation*}
where $\overline{r_{i}}$ is the average joke rating for user i, and
$\kappa$ is a normalizing factor ensuring that the absolute value of
the weights sum to 1. We used a function of Euclidean distance from user i to
user p as the weight w(i, p), and $\kappa$ = $\sum_{k=1}^n w(i,p)$.
Specifically, if we are interested in q nearest neighbors, $w(i; p) =
d(i, q +1)- d(i, p)$. This ensures that i’s closest neighbor has the
largest weight. In the present paper, we are using $K=50$ as the baseline algorithm to compare against more sophisticated algorithms.

\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Synthetic Data}

The performance of the SVT and SMC algorithms were compared on
synthetically generated matrices of varying ranks, sizes and sparsity.
Specifically, the algorithms were tested on all combinations of matrix
size (1000, 5000), rank (5, 10 and 20), and sparsity (30\%, 50\% and
70\%). As a baseline to SVT and SMC, a column mean matrix completion
method was implemented. This method predicts the average column value
for all missing entries. In the Tables 1,~\ref{Time} the mean
absolute error and the run time is averaged over the categories of
size, rank, and sparsity. For example, out of the eighteen tests that
were run, nine tests include the matrix of size 1000 $\times$ 1000. Therefore
the mean absolute error value for all nine tests are averaged in order
to represent the values in the size 1000 column of the table below.
Mean absolute error is the absolute value of the average error on the
unknown entries. Run time is measured in seconds and all simulations
were run at University of Michigan's CAEN lab computers (8GB memory
with one core i7 processors). The columns in
Tables 1,~\ref{Time} contain the averaged mean absolute error
and the run time for all experiments.

% choose include them if we want (Just uncomment) but it looks like we
% already have plenty of content. I also set this up to visualize the
% steps of SVT but they also were pretty uninteresting.



%\subsubsection{Low-Rank Recovery}

%Both Singular Value Thresholding and Spectral Matrix Completion
%actively seek low-rank solutions. Realistically, the matrices we hope
%to complete are not truly low-rank, but can often be approximated as
%such. We investigate both algorithms' ability to discover low-rank
%structure from noisy matrices in table \ref{rankrecover}.

%\begin{table} [ht!]
% \label{rankrecover}
%\centering
% \begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} % p{2cm}}
%   \hline \hline
%                & \multicolumn{5}{c}{Noise level} \\
%   Algorithm    & 0.0 & 0.1 & 1.0 & 5.0 & 10.0 \\ \hline
%   SVT          & 5 & 6 & 5 & 6 & 4 \\
%   SMC          & 5 & 5 & 5 & 5 & 3\\
%   \hline \hline
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\footnotesize Rank recovered from noisy entries from rank-5 matrices. 
% Matrices are size $100 \times 100$ with 25\% sparsity. Gaussian
% noise with increasing variance is added to each known entry. Noise
% level is the standard deviation of this noise}
%\end{table}

%We find that both methods are able to accurately recover the low-rank
%structure of matrices from a small number of noisy entries. It should
%however be noted that Singular Value Thresholding relies on heavy
%hyper-parameter tuning and may not behave as reliably when the true
%rank is unknown.


While low rank is a desirable property and a suitable target for
optimization, we are primarily concerned with accurately predicting
unknown entries in a matrix. 

\begin{table} [ht!]
\begin{center}
\caption{Mean Absolute Error of predictions of unknown entries. The tolerance in SMC and SVT algorithms were set to $10^{-6}$ as the stopping criterion.}
 \begin{tabular}{l | l l l | l l l |l l}% p{2cm}}

               & \mc{3}{c}{Rank}             & \mc{3}{c}{Sparsity}         & \mc{2}{c}{Size ($n \times n$)} \\
  Algorithm    & 5 & 10 & 20                 & 30\% & 50\% & 70\%          & 1000 & 5000 \\ \hline
  Mean         & 5.65 & 9.90 & 13.98         & 9.10 & 10.21 & 10.21        & 9.43 & 10.26\\
  SVT          & 2.05 & 7.2E-04 & 1.4E-03    & 2.05 & 8.4E-04 & 9.6E-04    & 1.37 & 7.6E-04\\
  SMC          & 2.1E-04 & 4.3E-07 & 4.5E-07 & 2.1E-04 & 4.2E-07 & 3.8E-07 & 1.4E-04 & 3.7E-07\\
 \hline \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{center}
\label{MAE}
\end{table}

Table 1 shows that both SVT and SMC outperform the baseline
column-mean method, which simply fills in all unknown entries in a
column with the mean of its known entries. In addition, SMC
consistently outperforms SVT in terms of mean absolute error, often by
several orders of magnitude.

We are also concerned with the speed at which we arrive at accurate
predictions. Table~\ref{Time} shows that, while SMC significantly
outperforms SVT in terms of accuracy, SVT significantly outperforms
SMC in terms of time. It appears that the computational cost of SMC
grows exponentially with the rank. Even at rank $5$, the smallest
tested rank value, SMC runs 9.6 times slower than SVT.

  \hline \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \label{Time}
\end{table}

Since the baseline algorithms (Eigentaste) needs at least few fully filled columns, we did not use baseline algorithms to compare the synthetic data. However, we use the baseline algorithms to compare in the next section with Jester joke dataset. 

\subsection{Jester Dataset}

The Jester Joke dataset contains 4.1 million ratings for 100 jokes
from 73,421 users \cite{r30}. A set of 10 ``seed'' jokes were chosen
to be presented to users before any others, and users that did not
rate all of the seed jokes were discarded. This leaves us with 10
completely dense columns, allowing us to apply both supervised
learning algorithms (Eigentaste, K-nearest neighbor) and matrix completion algorithms
(SVT, SMC). We hypothesize that the matrix completion algorithms will
outperform those that only take advantage of the dense columns because
matrix completion algorithms are capable of utilizing all data during training.

For the purpose of evaluation we randomly select subsets of 100, 200,
and 1000 users' ratings from the Jester Dataset. We choose two ratings
at random from each user as test points and leave the remainder for
training. We evaluate four algorithms, Eigentaste, k-nearest neighbor ($K = 50$), SMC, and SVT,
using the Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) of the reconstruction
on the test points, similar to~\cite{oh2010thesis}.

The NMAE, a commonly used performance metric in collaborative
filtering, is defined in terms of The Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
\begin{equation}
MAE = \frac{1}{|T|}\sum\limits_{(u,i) \in T} |M_{ui} - \widetilde{M}_{ui}|
\end{equation}
where $M_{ui}$ is the original ratings, $\widetilde{M}_{ui}$ is the predicted rating for user $u$, item $i$, and $T$ is the test set. The NMAE can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
NMAE = \frac{MAE}{M_{max}-M_{min}}
\end{equation}
where $M_{max}$ and $M_{min}$ are the upper and lower bounds for the
ratings. In the Jester joke dataset, the rating are in the range
$[-10,10]$.

%\begin{figure}[h!]

%\includegraphics[trim=0 0 0 0, clip, width=1.0\linewidth]{eigentaste_jester.tiff}

% $Re= 1.0 \times 10^6$ and $V = 12.4$ m/s. }
%\label{Geo}
%\end{figure}

Table~\ref{Compare} compares the NMAE for different number of users with all the four algorithms, namely, SMC, SVT, Eigentaste, and K-nearest neighbor. As noted from table~\ref{Compare}, SMC performs the best for all the different size of users. Another point to note that, generally, NMAE keeps increasing with the matrix size. Thus, in Table~\ref{SMC}, we present detailed numerical results on the Jester joke dataset with the SMC algorithm.

   \hline \hline
 \end{tabular}

\label{SMC}
\end{table}

To conclude, for the Jester joke dataset SMC algorithm performs best (in terms of NMAE) amongst the algorithms we compared against. 

\subsubsection{Visualization}

Each of the algorithms compared previously rely on the assumption that
the Jester Dataset can approximated using a low-rank matrix. To test
this claim, we plot each of the 100 jester jokes in a two-dimensional
plane and attempt to explain the meaning of the directions. In axes
according to the top two eigenvectors of the Singular Value
Thresholding solution.

\caption{Two-dimensional projection of the Jester joke dataset. The
  horizontal and vertical axes correspond to the directions of the
  first and second eigenvectors, respectively, of the completed matrix
  found by the SVT algorithm on the full Jester dataset. Also given
  are the most extreme jokes in each direction, which characterize the

In figure~\ref{jokes2d} we find that the two principal components in
the space of jokes correspond to short, simple puns (left) versus
longer, complex jokes (right), and rowdy jokes (top) versus clean
jokes (bottom). Only a few jokes are given here, but at closer
inspection these observations seem to hold true in general.


\section{Conclusions}

In the present paper, we explained various algorithms to solve matrix completion problem. In particular, we focused on Spectral Matrix Completion (SMC) algorithm and Spectral Value Thresholding (SVT) algorithm. We compared these sophisticated algorithm with various baseline algorithms, namely, column mean, eigentaste, and K-nearest neighbor algorithm. 
We checked the performance of the algorithms with synthetic data, with varying size, rank, and sparsity of the input matrix. We concluded that both SMC and SVT performs better than the baseline column-mean algorithm. Between SMC and SVT, while the SMC attains better accuracy than SVT, SMC takes longer time to converge than SVT. 
For the Jester joke dataset, we compared NMAE (Normalized Mean Absolute Error) for different users ({100, 200, 1000}) on SMC, SVT, Eigentaste, and K-nearest neighbor (with $K=50$). We concluded that the SMC performs the best (in terms for NMAE) for all the user sets selected in this paper. In terms of NMAE, SMC is followed by SVT, then Eigentaste, and lastly, K-nearest neighbor. This trend follows the intuition as well.
Lastly, we present a two dimensional representation of the entire 100 jokes in the Jester joke dataset. We went through the jokes individually, and tried to guess the axes to the best of our abilities. It seems it follows the general trend, as explained in the paper.



\section{Group Member's Accomplishments}

All team members participated in all aspects of the project as well as the final report. However, each member was
responsible for taking the lead on specific tasks. All team members contributed towards the literature review as well. Sriram implemented Eigentaste and K-nearest neighbor. He also had a leading role in the comparison of the methods on the Jester dataset. Nitin and Jeeheh lead the implementation of the SMC algorithm. Jeeheh took charge of the performance comparison on synthetic data. Nitin got the performance metric for different algorithms and  also carried out integration of the final report. Jonathan was in command of implementing the SVT algorithm and the two dimensional visualizations of the Jester dataset. He also contributed in comparing various algorithms for the synthetic dataset.
