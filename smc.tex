In the present paper, the Spectral Matrix Completion (SMC) algorithm presented in Keshavan et al.~\cite{keshavan2010matrix} is implemented. Lets say, $M$ is the matrix whose entry $(i,j) \in [m] \times [n]$ corresponding to the rating user $i$ would assign to movie/joke $j$. $M^E$ is the $m \times n$ matrix that contains the revealed entries of $M$, and is filled with 0's in the other positions 
\begin{equation}
M = \left \{ \begin{array}{rcl}
	M_{i,j} & \mbox{if  }  (i,j) \in E \\
	 0 & \mbox{otherwise} 
	\end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

As presented in~\cite{keshavan2010matrix}, the SMC algorithm has the following structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Trim the $M^E$, and let $\widetilde{M}^E$.
\item Project $\widetilde{M}^E$ to $T_r(\widetilde{M}^E)$.
\item Clean residual errors by minimizing the discrepancy F(X,Y).
\end{enumerate}
